		<p>This bookshelf contains new and adapted books produced by staff of Resources for the Blind, Inc. (RBI) and Philippine public school teachers who have learners with visual impairment in	their classes. The goal is to produce reading materials in a format that the students can easily access and readily understand. This is in keeping with RBIâ€™s mission to enable persons with visual impairment to reach their full potential in life through projects like this.</p>
		<p>The books in this collection were produced specifically with blind and visually-impaired students in mind. As such, the images used in the books were accompanied with highly descriptive audios to give non-sighted readers a clear understanding of what are shown on the pages. The audios were also done in languages that are widely used in the Philippines: English, Filipino and Cebuano. This is to ensure a better grasp of the stories and to provide readers with more options. These books were created as part of a pilot project conducted by SIL LEAD and funded by the All Children Reading: A Grand Challenge for Development (ACR GCD) Partners (the United States Agency for International Development [USAID], World Vision and the Australian Government) and Pearson.</p>
		<p>RBI is a non-government organization serving persons with visual impairment since 1988. For more than three decades, we have provided quality training to the blind and visually-impaired to help them reach and understand their full potential in life and service.</p>
