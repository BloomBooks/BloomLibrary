    <br />
    <div>For Linux, assuming you have followed the <a href="/installers/linux">instructions for installing bloom on Linux</a>, you just need one more command:

    <br />

    <h5>Metadata</h5>

    <div>A special feature of this package is that we have embedded, in the image files themselves, information on where they came from, what their license is, etc. This will allow programs to help you make sure you are using the images legally.</div>

    <br />

    <h5>Note</h5>

    <div>This is not the full "<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_product.asp?isbn=9781556712418">International Illustrations: The Art Of Reading</a>". That product, which comes as a DVD, includes 3rd-party commercial software for finding the image you want. In contrast, the package offered here contains only the images themselves, and is only useful when used from a program that can help you find images (namely WeSay and Bloom).<div>
