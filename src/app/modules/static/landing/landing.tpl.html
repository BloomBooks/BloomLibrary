              <H1>Goal: 10x More Books</H1>
              <P>Here's the problem Bloom addresses: when working in local-language literacy projects, we end up settling for what is practical, instead of what is actually needed. The hope is often that a primer and a handful of books will be enough to open up the joy and power of reading in minority language communities. But realistically, we know that it takes <i>stacks</i> of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the practice needed to develop true literacy. The problem has been who will make all those books? How will we find the time? Where will we get the content? So we settle for the possible and hope for the best.</P>

              <H1>Build Local Capacity</H1>
              <P>Bloom dramatically lowers the bar, so that many more people can get involved in building a large collection of local language books. Bloom was designed with new computer users in mind, and it has special features to guide them in simple book making, so people need far less training than alternatives such as Word, Publisher, or In Design.</P>

              <P>This week a new typist joined our workshop, and I spent half an hour showing him Bloom and then left him to it. When I checked on him later in the day, he was doing just fine. I thought, What other program could I have put in front of him such that he would be able to use it with just half an hour's orientation?!</P>

              <P>Got a book you'd like to share? Just add a major language translation (e.g. English, French, Thai) and then tell Bloom to upload it to the online library.</P>

              <h3>Shell Books</h3>
              <p>A growing collection of Creative Commons-licensed shell books help you grow your library quickly.  Just add a book to your vernacular library, then type in translations.</p>

              <h3>Template Books</h3>
              <p>Bloom isn't just for<em> shell</em> books. To create a brand new book, we use what Bloom calls a<em> template</em>. For most books, the "Basic Book" template is enough. It contains templates pages with the most frequently used layouts. There is also a Picture Dictionary template and Wall Calendar template.</p>

              <p>For each box of text, Bloom stores text in any a number of languages.  You can then tell it to show one, two, or three of those languages to make monolingual, bilingual, or trilingual versions of the publication.</p>

              <P>If you just want to get started using shellbooks, install Bloom on your computer, and then head to the&nbsp;<a href="/browse">Book Library</a>&nbsp;for some shellbooks you can translate.</P>
              <P>Have some existing books you'd like to get into Bloom? To do that, just copy the text and pictures from whatever program they are in now and paste into pages in Bloom.
