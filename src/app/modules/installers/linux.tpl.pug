	H2 Getting Bloom on Linux
	P Bloom 4.7 is available for Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), Bionic (18.04), and Focal (20.04).  It can also be installed on Wasta 16, Wasta 18, and Wasta 20. You are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.   Bloom 4.7 is the last version of Bloom supported in Ubuntu Xenial and Wasta 16 because those versions of Linux reach their end-of-life in early 2021.

	H3 Step 1: Try to install the Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt install bloom-desktop
	P If this succeeds, you can skip to step 4 below (you are already a user of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.  If this fails because apt cannot locate the package, then the following steps are needed.
	H3 Step 2: Add the SIL repository to your system
	P See
		+link('https://packages.sil.org/') Enable access to SIL software and fonts in Ubuntu
		| for alternative directions on how to add the SIL repository to your system.
	H4 (for xenial or wasta 16):
	pre wget -qO - https://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H4 (for bionic or wasta 18):
	pre wget -qO - https://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu bionic main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H4 (for focal or wasta 20):
	pre wget -qO - https://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu focal main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H3 Step 3: Install the  Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt install bloom-desktop
	H3 Step 4: Copy the desktop launcher to your local area
	pre cp -i /usr/share/applications/bloom.desktop ~/Desktop
	pre chmod +x ~/Desktop/bloom.desktop
	H3 Step 5: Launch the Application
	H4 (mouse)
	P Double click the desktop launcher icon
	H4 (keyboard)
	P Type the name of the program in a terminal window or into the dashboard or startup menu
	pre
		| bloom

	P Once Bloom has been installed, updates will be downloaded and installed the same way your system is already installing updates to other software.

	H2 Getting Bloom Beta Releases on Linux
	P A
		strong
			|  beta release
		|  of Bloom should be available for Ubuntu Bionic and Focal.  If available, it can also be installed on Wasta 18 and Wasta 20.  Again, you are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.  As with Windows, a current release of Bloom (bloom-desktop) can coexist with a beta release of Bloom (bloom-desktop-beta) on Linux: installing one does not affect the other.

	H3 Step 1: Try to install the beta release of the Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt install bloom-desktop-beta
	P If this succeeds, you can skip to step 5 below (and you are living as a constant beta tester of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.  If this fails because apt cannot locate the package, then the following steps are needed.
	H3 Step 2: Add the SIL experimental repository to your system
	P See
		+link('https://packages.sil.org/') Beta software
		| for alternative directions on how to add the experimental repository to your system.
	P The first command (which adds the security key for the SIL repositories) may be unnecessary if you already use SIL software.
	H4 (for bionic or wasta 18):
	pre wget -qO - https://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu bionic-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H4 (for focal or wasta 20):
	pre wget -qO - https://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu focal-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H3 Step 3: Install the beta release of the  Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt install bloom-desktop-beta
	H3 Step 4: Remove the experimental repository from your system for safety
	P Note that removing the experimental repository reference will prevent the beta version of Bloom from being updated.  So you have a trade-off to consider.  Do you want to always have the latest beta release of Bloom at the risk of getting other beta software that you don't want?  Or do you want to prevent surprises at the cost of going through the process of adding and removing the experimental repository reference every time a new beta release of Bloom is announced?
	H4 (for bionic or wasta 18)
	pre sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu bionic-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H4 (for focal or wasta 20)
	pre sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb https://packages.sil.org/ubuntu focal-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt update
	H3 Step 5: Copy the desktop launcher to your local area
	pre cp -i /usr/share/applications/bloom-beta.desktop ~/Desktop
	pre chmod +x ~/Desktop/bloom-beta.desktop
	H3 Step 6: Launch the Application
	H4 (mouse)
	P Double click the desktop launcher icon
	H4 (keyboard)
	P Type the name of the program in a terminal window or into the dashboard or startup menu
	pre
		| bloom-beta

	P Once a beta release of Bloom has been installed, updates to the beta release will not be downloaded and installed the same way your system installs updates to other software 
		strong
			|  unless you skip step 4 above
		| .
