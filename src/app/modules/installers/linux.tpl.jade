	H2 Getting Bloom on Linux
	P Bloom 3.7 is available for Ubuntu Precise, Trusty, and Xenial.  It can also be installed on Wasta 12, Wasta 14, and Wasta 16. You are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.

	H3 Step 1: Try to install the Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop
	P If this succeeds, you can skip to step 4 below (you are already a user of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.  If this fails because apt-get cannot locate the package, then the following steps are needed.
	H3 Step 2: Add the SIL repository to your system
	H4 (for precise or wasta12):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for trusty or wasta14):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for xenial or wasta16):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H3 Step 3: Get the release of the  Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop
	H3 Step 4: Copy the desktop launcher to your local area
	pre cp -i /usr/share/applications/bloom.desktop ~/Desktop
	pre chmod +x ~/Desktop/bloom.desktop
	H3 Step 5: Launch the Application
	H4 (mouse)
	P Double click the desktop launcher icon
	H4 (keyboard)
	P Type the name of the program in a command window or into the dashboard or startup menu
	pre
		| bloom

	P Once Bloom has been installed, updates will be downloaded and installed the same way your system is already installing updates to other software.

	H2 Note to current users of SIL software (December 2016)
	P For security reasons, the SIL repository is getting a new
		strong
			|  public key
		|  in January 2017.  Although the developers are making an effort to make this seamless for current users, it is possible that attempts to update or install software from the SIL repository may fail due to a mismatched key after January 1, 2017.  If that happens, the solution is simply to run the first command given above for adding the SIL repository to your system.  This will add the new repository public key to your system.

	H2 Getting Bloom Beta Releases on Linux
	P A
		strong
			|  beta release
		|  of Bloom may also be available for Ubuntu Trusty and Xenial.  If available, it can also be installed on Wasta 14 and Wasta 16.  Again, you are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.  (Note that support for Precise and Wasta 12 ends with Bloom 3.7 since Precise and Wasta 12 reach their &ldquo;end of life&rdquo; in early 2017.)  At this time, a current release of Bloom (bloom-desktop) cannot coexist with a beta release of Bloom (bloom-desktop-beta) on Linux: installing one uninstalls the other.  Unlike the situation with Windows, if the first two numbers of the version are the same, the third number is significant even if the package name changes from bloom-desktop-beta to bloom-desktop.  For example,  bloom-desktop 3.7.307 is newer than bloom-desktop-beta 3.7.304.

	H3 Step 1: Try to get the beta release of the Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop-beta
	P If this succeeds, you can skip to step 5 below (and you are living as a constant beta tester of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.  If this fails because apt-get cannot locate the package, then the following steps are needed.
	H3 Step 2: Add the SIL repository and the SIL experimental repository to your system
	P The first two commands may be unnecessary if you already use SIL software.
	H4 (for precise or wasta12):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise main"
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for trusty or wasta14):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty main"
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for xenial or wasta16):
	pre wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial main"
	pre sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H3 Step 3: Get the beta release of the  Bloom Desktop program
	pre
		| sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop-beta
	H3 Step 4: Remove the experimental repository from your system for safety
	H4 (for precise)
	pre sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for trusty)
	pre sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for xenial or wasta16)
	pre sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial-experimental main"
	pre sudo apt-get update
	H4 (for wasta12 or wasta14)
	pre synaptic
	P Using the graphical user interface, open the Settings / Repository dialog, then find and remove any entries in "Additional repositories" that include precise-experimental, trusty-experimental, or xenial-experimental in the fine print.
	H3 Step 5: Copy the desktop launcher to your local area
	pre cp -i /usr/share/applications/bloom.desktop ~/Desktop
	pre chmod +x ~/Desktop/bloom.desktop
	H3 Step 6: Launch the Application
	H4 (mouse)
	P Double click the desktop launcher icon
	H4 (keyboard)
	P Type the name of the program in a command window or into the dashboard or startup menu
	pre
		| bloom

	P Once a beta release of Bloom has been installed, updates to the beta release will be downloaded and installed the same way your system is already installing updates to other software.  However, you will not see any updates to the stable release of Bloom since it is no longer installed (if it ever was).
