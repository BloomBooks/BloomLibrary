You are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.</P><H3>Step 1: Try to install the Bloom Desktop program</H3><pre>sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop</pre><P>If this succeeds, you can skip to step 4 below (you are already a user of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.

Although the developers are making an effort to make this seamless for current users, it is possible that attempts to update or install software from the SIL repository may fail due to a mismatched key after January 1, 2017.  If that happens, the solution is simply to run the first command given above for adding the SIL repository to your system.  This will add the new repository public key to your system.  For convenience, this command is repeated here.</P><pre>wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -</pre><H2>Getting Bloom Beta Releases on Linux</H2><P>A<strong> beta release</strong> of Bloom may be available for Ubuntu Trusty and Xenial.  If available, it can also be installed on Wasta 14 and Wasta 16.  Again, you are welcome to try other versions of Linux but we cannot promise to support them.  (Note that support for Precise and Wasta 12 ends with Bloom 3.7 since Precise and Wasta 12 reach their &ldquo;end of life&rdquo; in early 2017.)  As with Windows, a current release of Bloom (bloom-desktop) can coexist with a beta release of Bloom (bloom-desktop-beta) on Linux: installing one does not affect the other.</P><H3>Step 1: Try to install the beta release of the Bloom Desktop program</H3><pre>sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop-beta</pre><P>If this succeeds, you can skip to step 5 below (and you are living as a constant beta tester of SIL software).  If this fails because of authorization issues or a missing sudo program, you need to consult with the local Linux administrator.  If this fails because apt-get cannot locate the package, then the following steps are needed.</P><H3>Step 2: Add the SIL experimental repository to your system</H3><P>See&nbsp;<a href="http://packages.sil.org/">Install Beta SIL software</a>&nbsp;for alternative directions on how to add the experimental repository to your system.</P><P>The first command (which adds the security key for the SIL repositories) may be unnecessary if you already use SIL software.</P><H4>(for trusty or wasta 14):</H4><pre>wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -</pre><pre>sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty-experimental main"</pre><pre>sudo apt-get update</pre><H4>(for xenial or wasta 16):</H4><pre>wget -qO - http://packages.sil.org/sil.gpg | sudo apt-key add -</pre><pre>sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial-experimental main"</pre><pre>sudo apt-get update</pre><H3>Step 3: Install the beta release of the  Bloom Desktop program</H3><pre>sudo apt-get install bloom-desktop-beta</pre><H3>Step 4: Remove the experimental repository from your system for safety</H3><P>Note that removing the experimental repository reference will prevent the beta version of Bloom from being updated.  So you have a trade-off to consider.  Do you want to always have the latest beta release of Bloom at the risk of getting other beta software that you don't want?  Or do you want to prevent surprises at the cost of going through the process of adding and removing the experimental repository reference every time a new beta release of Bloom is announced?</P><H4>(for trusty)</H4><pre>sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty-experimental main"</pre><pre>sudo apt-get update</pre><H4>(for wasta 14)</H4><pre>synaptic</pre><P>Using the graphical user interface, open the Settings / Repository dialog, then find and remove any entries in "Additional repositories" that include trusty-experimental in the fine print.</P><H4>(for xenial or wasta 16)</H4><pre>sudo add-apt-repository --remove "deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial-experimental main"</pre><pre>sudo apt-get update</pre><H3>Step 5: Copy the desktop launcher to your local area</H3><pre>cp -i /usr/share/applications/bloom-beta.desktop ~/Desktop</pre><pre>chmod +x ~/Desktop/bloom-beta.desktop</pre><H3>Step 6: Launch the Application</H3><H4>(mouse)</H4><P>Double click the desktop launcher icon</P><H4>(keyboard)</H4><P>Type the name of the program in a terminal window or into the dashboard or startup menu</P><pre>bloom-beta</pre><P>Once a beta release of Bloom has been installed, updates to the beta release will not be downloaded and installed the same way your system installs updates to other software <strong> unless you skip step 4 above</strong>.</P></div>
