				| Fonts

				| Bloom installs SIL&rsquo;s&nbsp;
				a(href='http://software.sil.org/andika/') Andika New Basic
				| &nbsp;font which was designed specifically for easier reading in roman scripts.
			p You can also use a font you already have installed on your computer, but it needs to be a Unicode font. Note that some fonts don't have built-in italics or bold faces. These will look fine on screen, but will not show bold or italics in print or in PDFs.
			p SIL offers free Unicode fonts for a variety of needs:
			ul
				li
					a(href='http://software.sil.org/andika/') Andika
					| , designed for literacy materials, especially for beginning readers.
					+link('http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_New_Basic#AvsANB') Andika covers a wide range of characters
					| that Andika New Basic does not, but it will not show bold or italics in print or PDF.
