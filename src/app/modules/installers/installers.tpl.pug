			h2 The Art of Reading
			p
				| We also recommend that you download and install the
				+link('/artofreading') Art Of Reading
				|illustration collection. This free collection contains more than 10,000 line drawings suitable for use in reading materials. Bloom is designed to enable you to search and select illustrations from this collection once you have installed it.
			h2
				| Fonts
			p
				| Bloom installs SIL&rsquo;s&nbsp;
				a(href='http://software.sil.org/andika/') Andika New Basic
				| &nbsp;font which was designed specifically for easier reading in roman scripts.
			p You can also use a font you already have installed on your computer, but it needs to be a Unicode font. Note that some fonts don't have built-in italics or bold faces. These will look fine on screen, but will not show bold or italics in print or in PDFs.
			p SIL offers free Unicode fonts for a variety of needs:
			ul
				li
					a(href='http://software.sil.org/andika/') Andika
					| , designed for literacy materials, especially for beginning readers.
					+link('http://scripts.sil.org/Andika_New_Basic#AvsANB') Andika covers a wide range of characters
					| that Andika New Basic does not, but it will not show bold or italics in print or PDF.
				li
					a(href='http://software.sil.org/annapurna/') Annapurna
					| , for languages that use Devanagari script
				li
					a(href='http://software.sil.org/scheherazade') Scheherezade
					| , an extended Arabic script font
				li
					a(href='http://software.sil.org/abyssinica/') Abyssinica
					| , an Ethiopic script font (also sometimes called &ldquo;fidel&rdquo;
					| script)
			p If you're having trouble finding a font for your language, check out
				+link("http://scriptsource.org/") ScriptSource.

			h2 Typing
			p
				| Bloom assumes that you already have a way to type your language on your computer. If you need a way to type your language and lack one, check out
				+link("http://scriptsource.org") ScriptSource
				| . On Windows you might consider&nbsp;
				a(href='http://keyman.com/desktop/download.php') Keyman
				| , available in a free edition.
			h2
				a
				| Help getting started and learning Bloom
			p
				| Bloom is easy to use, but you may find it helpful to watch the&nbsp;
				a(href='http://tiny.cc/bloomVimeo')
					| Bloom training videos
				| . Start with&nbsp;
				a(href='https://vimeo.com/channels/bloomlibrary') Bloom: who is it for?
			p You can download all the Bloom training videos to your computer so that you can share them with people who don't have good or inexpensive internet connections.
				| &nbsp;
				a(href='http://tiny.cc/bloomHDVideos') High-resolution videos
				| &nbsp;or&nbsp;
				a(href='http://tiny.cc/bloomSDVideos') Low-resolution videos (smaller files)

			h2 Talking Books
			p
				| Bloom has the ability to record sound and then use those recordings to create a "Talking Book" e-book. However, Bloom versions earlier than 4.1 need a program called "LAME for Audacity" in order to create the mp3 files that the e-book will use. Setting it up is easy. First download and run
				+link('http://lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl') 'Lame_v3.99 for Windows.exe'
				| . Next, restart Bloom.
