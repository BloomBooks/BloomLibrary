        h5.termsSub Notice and Takedown Procedure
        div.termsItem
            | It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the
            | United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
            | This page describes the information that should be present in these notices.
            | It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to the Bloom Library as straightforward
            | as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.
            | The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which
            | can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, https://www.copyright.gov/),
            | but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.
        div.termsItem
            | It is expected that all users of any part of the Bloom Library site will comply with applicable copyright laws.
            | However, if the Bloom Library receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response
            | to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing
            | activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under
            | United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
        div.termsItem
            | If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the
            | owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant
            | to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
