      h3 General Description
    | Welcome to the Bloom Library.
    | To provide you with Services, we have to set out some ground rules for using the Site in this document (the "Terms"). By accessing, using, or contributing to the Services or the Site, and in consideration for the Services we provide to you, you agree to abide by the Terms.
    .termsItem
      | Bloom Library may change the Terms from time to time, at the Bloom Library's sole discretion. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of such changes will constitute your assent to all such changes.

      h3 Key things to know about book submission
    ul
      li
        | All of your book's content must be either in the public domain, your own content, or content that you have permission to republish.
        | Your book's Credits or Title Page must give credit to images used and describe the terms under which they are being used in the book (e.g.
        +link('https://creativecommons.org/', '_blank') Creative Commons license
        | ).
        +space
        strong
          | The presence of an image
          | on the Internet (a blog, news reports, a clipart site, etc.) does not give you the right to republish it here, even if you give credit.
        +space
        | Nor does a site saying "Royalty Free".
      li
        | We cannot accept submissions containing material reused under "Fair Use" doctrine, because the whole point of this site is to enable others to continuously republish many copies, in multiple languages.
      li
        | We may remove a book if it is not obvious from a glance at the Credits and Title Page that you have given credit and described the terms under which you are using the book's images.
      li
        | We receive some books that are unlikely to ever be translated and published.
        | These books are often patched together with images from various sources, done in training sessions or as a school project.
        | These projects are good for practicing with Bloom, but they may not be publishable quality.
        | Why do we care?
        | The problem is that it costs our users to browse through low quality material in both time and, for many in the developing world, internet charges.
        | We also pay to store book content on servers.
        | So if we judge that a book is highly unlikely to be used by the minority languages communities that this site serves, we may remove it.
      li
        | We may remove books that contain subject matter incompatible with the goals of this site.

        | You give us permission to use any contributions you make as needed to operate the site, and to share them with others according to the permissions you give.
      li
        | You understand the typical privacy risks of using a web site, and in particular,
