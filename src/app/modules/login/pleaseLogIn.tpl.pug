        div Bloom Library requires you to log in for several reasons:
        ul
            li To search for books you uploaded, so we know whose books to search for.
            li For actions that send an email, to make things harder for spammers.
            li For uploading books, because we need to know who is responsible for putting the book on our site.
            li For deleting books, because you can only delete the ones you contributed.
